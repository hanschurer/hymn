# React philosophy

We can read from the Doc of React: 
> We think React is the preferred way to build large, responsive web applications in JavaScript. It excels on Facebook and Instagram.

As you can see, the key is to achieve rapid response. So what are the constraints to rapid response?

There are two types of scenarios that constrain fast response when we use apps and browse the web on a daily basis:

When encountering a large amount of computational operations or the lack of performance of the device makes the page drop frames, resulting in lag.

After sending a network request, we need to wait for the data to be returned before we can proceed further, resulting in an inability to respond quickly.
