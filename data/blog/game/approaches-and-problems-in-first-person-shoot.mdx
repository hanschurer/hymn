A first-person shooter is a first-person perspective shooter in which the player experiences the
action through the three-dimensional view of the character. (Jay Garmon, 2005) This kind of
genre game's primary design focus is on combat or advancing to certain waypoints to
accomplish objectives set by the developer. In single-player mode, this involves the player
using guns or other types of long-range weapons to eliminate those pre-made enemies (AI)
targets in the game. (Veldhuis, 2010)

The video game industry has been looking for convenient and practical ways for game non-
player characters (AI) to make intelligent decisions quickly and efficiently. This includes
navigation features that help characters move through 3D environments, such as the most
used A* algorithm. The A * is a computer algorithm that extends Dijkstra's algorithm with
some of the features of Breadth First Search (BFS). The A* algorithm is widely used for
shortest pathfinding in games. It efficiently draws the shortest path between multiple nodes or
points on a graph. (Thaddeus Abiy, 2020) In Left 4 Dead, an A* algorithm pathfinding
algorithm is used to move an AI to a certain location. (Booth, 2009).

Although the A* algorithm is one of the most versatile algorithms in the industry, it is not
foolproof. It cannot handle things like co-movement, moving obstacles, map changes, danger
zones, formation, turn radius, object size, animation, path smoothing or many other topics by
itself and developers need to solve these problems by combining other algorithms like genetic
algorithms, reinforcement learning, etc. (Red Blob Games, 2014)

NPCs in first-person shooter games often use Finite State Machine(FSM) to manage their
behavior. (Hoorn, Togelius,& Schmidhuber, 2009). An FSM is a computational model which
consisting of more than one states. Only one state will be allowed to active at the one time, so
the AI need to switch from one state to another in order to acts different operation. Although
finite state machines have been around for a long time, they are still quite common and useful
in modern games.

Finite state machines also have a few problems. If we need to develop AI with multiple states,
then we have to consider multiple possible states of AI behavior. If the number of such states
may reach 100 or more. This causes a dramatic increase in code complexity, making it very
difficult to add new programs and the system becomes unmanageable or even has to reinvent
machine. Their logic is also limited, and all you can do is edit the transitions from one state to
another. It occurs when a state machine reaches a state and cannot exist because no valid input
would trigger such activity. This often leads to behavior with unknown results, which can
cause the system to fail. (Vorkflowengine,2020 )

Therefore, the idea of organizing tasks in a tree-like structure (also called behavior trees) has
emerged in some games. In contrast to FSM, behavior trees provide a framework for
designing more understandable and accessible AI in many cases. Moreover, well-organized
trees make visual debugging easier in practice. (Jakob Rasmussen, 2016)
