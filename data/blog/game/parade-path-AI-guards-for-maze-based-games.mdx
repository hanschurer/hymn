A graph usually consists of two types of elements: nodes and edges. Nodes are usually
described as points or circles, and the lines between points are called edges.(Millington, 2006)
In terms of pathfinding, waypoints are locations in the level where the pathfinding system is
used to connect areas in the level. In normal wayfinding, they are used to tell the AI how to
get from point A to point B without going through walls or taking a route that doesn't seem
reasonable to the player. To increase the fun of the game, we could have some tactical
waypoints. Waypoint tactics are about giving waypoints more information so that the AI can
make more complex and informed decisions. (Timothy Carbone, 2019)

In this graph, if players want to reach the yellow ball location, which is the location of the
treasure, they need to go through at least one or two of the three gates. To increase the
difficulty of the game, the route of travel of the two red balls must be around the three gates
for movement. This is to ensure that players do not get the treasure too easily. We can see that
there are three small square barriers in the area where the player was born. In the remaining
two areas there is also one each. These small square areas are effective in blocking the AI's
view as the AI can only see the front 90 degrees of the area. This will help players to find
some cover points or shadows to hide.
We could design waypoints with attributes to help players avoid the sight of the guards. In
this game. We can simply store two tactical qualities: shadow and cover so we could presume
the best places for the player to hide in order to avoid the guard.
Guard A waypoints and their thoughts:
1. Node1 is the starting point.
2. The second point is to block gate2 to prevent players from passing.
3. The third point is to give players more challenges, through the use of cover points and
shadow can be very good to avoid the sight of the guards.
4. Node 4 and node 6 are to prevent the player pass through gate2 too easy, the guards will
turn back to better guard the gate3 to prevent players from getting the treasure.
5. Node 5 is to eliminate dead space to prevent players from staying in the shadow point too
long to wait for the guard to pass.
Guard B waypoints and their thoughts:
1. Node1 and node 2 is the starting point to prevent player pass the gate 1.
2. Node3 is to monitor the lower half of the lower-left corner area. This can be done in
conjunction with guard1 to maximize the restriction of the player's position so that the
player can maximize the use of cover points to hide themselves.
3. Node4 is to strengthen to prevent players from passing gate1, Node5 is to eliminate the
shadow point in the lower-left corner to prevent players from staying in the shadow point for too long.
4. Finally, Node6 is designed to work with Guard1 to guard the waypoint of gate3.
